## What is a Decision Tree?

A decision tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm that makes decisions by splitting data into branches based on feature values. 
Each internal node represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents an output class.

## What I Did

- Loaded the Iris dataset from sklearn
- Split the data into training and testing sets
- Trained a decision tree classifier
- Evaluated the model using accuracy

The model achieved perfect accuracy on the test set for this simple dataset.
